# Agency Swarm Framework Implementation Plan

## 1. Agency Structure
- Create a new directory: `aigent_repo/aigent/development_agency/`
- Create files:
  - `agency.py`: Main Agency class
  - `agency_manifesto.md`: Agency description, mission statement, and operating environment

## 2. Define Agents
- Create subdirectories for each agent (e.g., `ceo`, `developer`, `virtual_assistant`)
- In each agent's directory:
  - Create `__init__.py`
  - Create agent file (e.g., `ceo.py`, `developer.py`, `virtual_assistant.py`)
  - Create `instructions.md` with role, goals, and process workflow
  - Create `tools` directory

## 3. Implement Tools
- For each tool required by an agent:
  - Create a new file in the agent's `tools` directory
  - Implement the tool following the BaseTool structure from agency_swarm.tools
  - Ensure proper package imports and environment variable handling

## 4. Update agency.py
- Import all created agents
- Define Agency class with appropriate communication flows
- Implement shared instructions using agency_manifesto.md

## 5. Create agency_manifesto.md
- Include agency description, mission statement, and operating environment

## 6. Update requirements.txt
- Add new dependencies required for the agency and its tools

## 7. Refactor and Move Relevant Code
- Identify relevant code from existing aigent_repo
- Refactor code to fit new structure (as agents or tools)
- Move refactored code to appropriate locations in new agency structure

## 8. Implement Logging
- Use custom logger consistently across new and refactored code
- Implement structured logging in all agents and tools

## 9. Testing
- Create unit tests for each tool and agent
- Implement integration test for the entire agency

## 10. Documentation
- Create README files for the agency and each agent
- Ensure proper documentation with docstrings and comments

## Next Steps
1. Create the `development_agency` directory and `agency.py` file
2. Begin implementing the Agency class in `agency.py`
3. Create `agency_manifesto.md` and define agency's mission and operating environment
4. Create the first agent (e.g., CEO) with associated files and directory structure

Follow this plan step-by-step to ensure a consistent and organized implementation of the Agency Swarm Framework within the existing project structure.
