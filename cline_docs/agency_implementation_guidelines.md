# Agency Swarm Framework Implementation Guidelines

## 1. Creating the Main Agency File

Create a new file `agency.py` in the `aigent_repo/aigent/development_agency/` directory with the following content:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agency
from .ceo.ceo import CEOAgent
from .developer.developer import DeveloperAgent

class DevelopmentAgency(Agency):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="Development Agency",
            description="An agency focused on software development and project management.",
            agents=[
                CEOAgent(),
                DeveloperAgent()
            ],
            communication_flows=[
                ("CEO", "Developer"),
                ("Developer", "CEO")
            ],
            shared_instructions="agency_manifesto.md"
        )

# Agency initialization and other necessary setup will be added here
```

## 2. Creating the Agency Manifesto

Create a new file `agency_manifesto.md` in the `aigent_repo/aigent/development_agency/` directory with the following content:

```markdown
# Development Agency Manifesto

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to deliver high-quality software solutions efficiently and effectively, leveraging the power of AI-driven collaboration and automation.

## Operating Environment
We operate in a fast-paced, technology-driven environment where adaptability, innovation, and continuous learning are key to success.

## Core Values
1. Excellence in Software Development
2. Collaborative Problem Solving
3. Continuous Learning and Improvement
4. Ethical AI Implementation
5. User-Centric Design

## Agency Goals
1. Streamline software development processes
2. Enhance code quality and maintainability
3. Improve project management efficiency
4. Foster innovation in AI-driven development tools
5. Ensure seamless integration of AI agents in the development lifecycle

## Communication Guidelines
1. All agents should communicate clearly and concisely
2. Use appropriate tools for inter-agent communication
3. Escalate issues to the CEO agent when necessary
4. Provide regular status updates on assigned tasks
5. Seek clarification when instructions or requirements are unclear
```

## 3. Implementing Agents

Refer to the following documents for detailed agent implementations:
- CEO Agent: `cline_docs/ceo_agent_definition.md`
- Developer Agent: `cline_docs/developer_agent_definition.md`

Ensure that each agent is implemented in its respective directory within `aigent_repo/aigent/development_agency/`.

## 4. Communication Flows

The current communication flows are set up as follows:
- CEO can communicate with Developer
- Developer can communicate with CEO

Implement these flows in the `communication_flows` parameter of the DevelopmentAgency class.

## 5. Integration Steps

1. Implement the CEO and Developer agents as defined in their respective definition documents.
2. Create the necessary tool files for each agent in their `tools` directories.
3. Update the `agency.py` file to import and initialize both agents.
4. Implement the communication flows between the agents.
5. Ensure that the shared instructions from `agency_manifesto.md` are properly loaded and accessible to all agents.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

Implement error handling and logging across all agent and tool implementations:
1. Use the custom logger defined in `aigent_repo/aigent/utils/logger.py`.
2. Log important events, errors, and inter-agent communications.
3. Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
4. Refer to `cline_docs/error_handling_and_logging_guidelines.md` for detailed guidelines.

## 7. Testing

1. Create unit tests for each agent and their respective tools.
2. Implement integration tests to ensure proper communication between agents.
3. Test the overall agency functionality with various scenarios.

## 8. Documentation

1. Update the project's README.md file to include information about the new Agency Swarm Framework implementation.
2. Document any new dependencies in the project's requirements.txt file.
3. Ensure all code is properly commented and follows the project's documentation standards.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the CEO agent and its tools.
2. Implement the Developer agent and its tools.
3. Update the `agency.py` file with the new agents and communication flows.
4. Create unit and integration tests for the new implementation.
5. Update project documentation to reflect the new Agency Swarm Framework structure.
6. Review and refine the implementation as needed.

Remember to follow the Agency Swarm Framework documentation and best practices throughout the implementation process. Regularly commit your changes and test thoroughly at each stage of the implementation.
