## Implementation Guidelines
1. Create a new directory: `aigent_repo/aigent/development_agency/ceo/`
2. Create the following files in the CEO agent directory:
   - `__init__.py`
   - `ceo.py`
   - `instructions.md` (containing the information from this document)
3. Implement the CEO agent class in `ceo.py`:

```python
from agency_swarm import Agent
from .tools.strategic_analysis_tool import StrategicAnalysisTool
from .tools.resource_allocation_tool import ResourceAllocationTool
from .tools.decision_making_tool import DecisionMakingTool
from .tools.communication_tool import CommunicationTool
from .tools.performance_evaluation_tool import PerformanceEvaluationTool

class CEOAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="CEO",
            description="Chief Executive Officer responsible for high-level decision making and strategy formulation.",
            instructions="instructions.md",
            tools=[
                StrategicAnalysisTool(),
                ResourceAllocationTool(),
                DecisionMakingTool(),
                CommunicationTool(),
                PerformanceEvaluationTool()
            ]
        )

    # Implement additional methods as needed
```

4. Create a `tools` directory within the CEO agent directory and implement each tool as a separate Python file.
5. Update the `agency.py` file to include the CEO agent in the `agents` list.
6. Implement proper error handling and logging in the CEO agent and its tools.
7. Create unit tests for the CEO agent and its tools.

Remember to follow the Agency Swarm Framework best practices and maintain consistency with the existing codebase.
