# Current Task: Set up new repository and transfer existing codebase

## Objectives

1. Transfer backend code (aigent_repo/aigent) [Completed]
2. Document frontend components to be created [Completed]
3. Update documentation to reflect new structure [Completed]
4. Ensure all necessary dependencies are included [Completed]
5. Document necessary environment variables [Completed]
6. Create contributing guidelines [Completed]
7. Add project license [Completed]

## Steps

1. Backend code transfer: [Completed]
2. Document frontend components to be created: [Completed]
3. Update documentation: [Completed]
4. Dependencies: [Completed]
5. Environment Variables: [Completed]
6. Create CONTRIBUTING.md: [Completed]
7. Create LICENSE file: [Completed]

## Backend Dependencies

[List of backend dependencies - unchanged]

## Frontend Dependencies

[List of frontend dependencies - unchanged]

## Environment Variables

[List of environment variables - unchanged]

## Summary of Accomplishments

1. Transferred and restructured the backend code
2. Documented frontend components to be created in the future
3. Updated project documentation (README.md, codebaseSummary.md, techStack.md)
4. Listed all necessary backend and frontend dependencies
5. Documented required environment variables
6. Created CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
7. Added MIT LICENSE to the project

## Next Steps

With the completion of these tasks, we have successfully set up the new repository structure and transferred the existing codebase. The next phase of the project should focus on:

1. Implementing the frontend components based on the documented placeholders
2. Integrating the frontend with the backend services
3. Applying error handling and logging guidelines across the entire codebase
4. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
5. Conducting thorough testing of the entire system
6. Preparing for the initial deployment of the application

These next steps will bring the project closer to a fully functional and deployable state.
