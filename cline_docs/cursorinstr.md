# Summary of Instructions and Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the steps taken to resolve the Google Cloud credentials connection issues within the Dockerized backend and frontend services.

## Issues Addressed

- **Google Cloud Credentials Not Found:** The application was unable to locate and utilize the Google Cloud credentials necessary for processing files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)

- **Backend Service:**
  - **Environment Variable:** Added `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to specify the path to the credentials file.
  - **Volume Mount:** Mounted the decrypted `credentials.json` file into the container.

  ```yaml
  environment:
    - FLASK_APP=app.py
    - FLASK_ENV=production
    - GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROCESSOR_ID=cdbb7ba4f9c316d0
    - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials/credentials.json
  volumes:
    - ./credentials.json:/app/credentials/credentials.json:ro
  ```

- **Frontend Service:**
  - **Removed Credentials Mount:** Eliminated the mounting of credentials to enhance security, as the frontend does not require direct access to Google Cloud services.

  ```yaml
  environment:
    - GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROCESSOR_ID=cdbb7ba4f9c316d0
  # Removed the following lines
  # - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials/google-cloud-key.json
  # - ./credentials.json:/app/credentials/google-cloud-key.json:ro
  ```

### 2. Frontend Dockerfile (`aigent-frontend/Dockerfile`)

- **Reverted to `npm ci`:** Ensured the frontend uses `npm ci` for installing dependencies to maintain consistency with `package-lock.json`.

  ```dockerfile
  RUN npm ci
  ```

- **Removed Credentials Handling:** Confirmed that the frontend Dockerfile does not handle or mount Google Cloud credentials, aligning with security best practices.

### 3. Backend Requirements (`backend/requirements.txt`)

- **No Changes Needed:** The `requirements.txt` file remains unchanged as all credential-related configurations were handled in the `docker-compose.yml`.

### 4. Credentials Management

- **Decryption with Git Secret:** Ensured that `credentials.json` is properly decrypted before running Docker containers.

  ```bash
  git secret reveal
  ```

- **Secure Credential Files:** Added `credentials.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

  ```gitignore
  # .gitignore
  credentials.json
  ```

## Verification Steps

1. **Decrypt Credentials:**
   - Ran `git secret reveal` to decrypt `credentials.json`.

2. **Rebuild and Restart Containers:**
   - Executed the following command to apply changes:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

3. **Verify Credentials in Backend Container:**
   - Accessed the backend container and confirmed the presence of `credentials.json`:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <backend_container_name> /bin/bash
     ls /app/credentials/
     cat /app/credentials/credentials.json
     ```

4. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Checked backend logs to ensure successful authentication with Google Cloud:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs backend
     ```

## Additional Recommendations

- **Automate Decryption:**
  - Create a script to automate the decryption and startup process.
    ```bash
    # decrypt_and_run.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    git secret reveal
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
  - Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x decrypt_and_run.sh
    ```
  - Run the script to streamline operations:
    ```bash
    ./decrypt_and_run.sh
    ```

- **Ensure Frontend Security:**
  - Confirm that the frontend does not require access to Google Cloud credentials to minimize security risks.

## Conclusion

By updating the `docker-compose.yml` to correctly set environment variables and mount the decrypted credentials file for the backend service, and by removing unnecessary credential access from the frontend service, the Google Cloud credentials connection issue has been resolved. These changes enhance both the security and functionality of the Dockerized application.
