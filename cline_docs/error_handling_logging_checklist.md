# Error Handling and Logging Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing error handling and logging in the OCR system. Ensure each item is addressed for any new code or when updating existing components.

## Error Handling

- [ ] Identify potential error scenarios in the component/function
- [ ] Implement try-catch blocks for error-prone operations
- [ ] Create and use custom error classes for specific error types, if applicable
- [ ] Ensure errors are propagated appropriately (e.g., to the UI or to a higher-level error handler)
- [ ] Provide clear, user-friendly error messages for expected error scenarios
- [ ] Implement proper error recovery mechanisms where possible

## Logging

- [ ] Import the centralized logger in the file
- [ ] Add appropriate log statements at key points in the code flow
- [ ] Use the correct log levels (error, warn, info, debug) based on the nature of the log
- [ ] Include relevant context in log messages (e.g., file names, user IDs, operation types)
- [ ] Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys)
- [ ] Ensure log messages are clear and provide actionable information

## Async Operations

- [ ] Use async/await with try-catch for asynchronous operations
- [ ] Handle promise rejections appropriately
- [ ] Log the start and completion (success or failure) of important async operations

## Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests to verify error handling behaves as expected
- [ ] Include test cases for both expected and unexpected error scenarios
- [ ] Verify that appropriate log messages are generated in different scenarios

## Code Review

- [ ] Ensure error handling and logging are consistent with project guidelines
- [ ] Check that error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Verify that log messages provide sufficient context for debugging
- [ ] Confirm that no sensitive information is being logged

## Documentation

- [ ] Update component/function documentation to include information about possible errors and how they're handled
- [ ] Document any new custom error types
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect error responses, if applicable

Remember to refer to the `error_handling_and_logging_guidelines.md` document for detailed best practices and examples. If you encounter any scenarios not covered by the guidelines, discuss with the team to determine the best approach and update the guidelines accordingly.
