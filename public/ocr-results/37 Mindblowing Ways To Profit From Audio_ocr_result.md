I bet you're sitting on some untapped profits
right now that you didn't even know about! Best
of all, grabbing those profits doesn't require
creating heaps of new content, complicated
funnels, or paying a king's ransom in support
and marketing.
We all witnessed Clubhouse go from zero to a
$4B evaluation in less than a year. Why?
Because people love audio. It's that simple.
That's why Facebook, Spotify and Twitter all
have audio platforms. And now you can too!
What people don't like about social audio
platforms is the amount of time they have to
invest just to get a nugget of wisdom. We'll put a
stop to that too.
You are now holding a blueprint on how to
quickly turn your knowledge into profitable audio
products in a matter of hours - not weeks or
months! You don't need a tech guy. You don't
need to give away all your profits to the Fat
Cats. And you don't need a big following.
For the most part, this process is like sitting down
to have coffee with a best friend. She is stuck
and asked for your advice. You're going to learn
how to give it to him in a way that will get him
results fast.
(Because that's what best friends do, right?)
You're in the right place

confidence grew so much, that I came
home and got an MBA and MIS while
still finishing my undergrad degrees.
But even with these fancy degrees
and an impressive resume, I found
myself living out of my car for
months.
Why?
Because college only taught me how
to create a resume and debt. It didn't
teach me how to sell, negotiate,
create or use my voice.
Pandemic Wake-up Call
The college scam got a huge spotlight
in 2020 and we're realizing what a
waste of money it can be for most
people. 
Instead, people like you, who are in
the trenches, got the results, and can
share a process are the best way to
get the skills needed to gain freedom.

broken system
What I remember about school is being
told to be quiet, be realistic and get a "real
job".  Hearing that I would most likely flunk
out of college; believing I was different,
and therefore bad, because I could never
muster the discipline to sit through an
entire class
My only motivation was to prove them
wrong. But I failed. My second year of
college I ready to drop out.
Then a miracle happened.
Instead of quitting, I got a job at a fast
food chain and a Chinese restaurant, and
saved every penny so I could study
abroad.
For the first time in my life, I boarded a
plane and flew to Germany to live there for
a year.
I learned more in the two months than my
entire high school or college career. My

Let's face it...create a video of yourself
can be a huge showstopper. It's
awkward, costs money, and takes way
too much time. Let's just say you
manage to tackle that mental hurdle,
you still have the membership site,
funnel, ads and all the tech. Let's say
you master that too...then the truth
comes to town...
Completion rate is 2%
So the refunds pour in
Customers give away your course
Someone pirates it
And you're ready to call it quits
My customers not only finished the
content and felt really darn proud of
themselves, they came back asking
for more. Selling my higher ticket
products became a breeze. They
already accomplished exactly what
they needed to go to the next level
too. 
Some of the untold benefits of audio
is that:
It's the closest thing to 1-on-1.
You're literally in their heads!
They get addicted to listening to
you and want more.
It's far easier and cheaper to
make than videos.
With Hiro.fm, nobody can pirate
your work(that alone deserves a
standing ovation!)
Why audio?

beyond audiobooks
I was in the exact same boat. And out of
desperation, I stripped the audio from
my course and gave it to my customers.
That's when a miracle happened...

The first thing I want to do is is save you from 
 getting trapped on the “content treadmill” - that
feeling like you’re never fully caught up, and the
constant pressure to create more and more
content at a fast, never-ending rate. 
Fear not! This is going to save you!
This next section will dive deep into how to plan
audio products in a way that makes sense for
your business, provides real value for your
listeners, and can be created and set-up in a way
that is low stress. 
The secrets behind ‘how’ to plan your audio
products is to start out with the easiest way for
your customers to get results. This guide gives
you plenty to pick from - and our Facebook
group has even more examples. Just keep it
simple.
Overwhelm is the #1 reason that customers ask
for refunds. 
Most often, it’s not about the value of the
content. They leave because they are
overwhelmed because there's just so much of it.
Other reasons for overwhelm are not being able
to find what they are looking for, or not being
able to figure out what they should do next.

Making Your Audio Irresistible
To make your audio product pop, add
something that is maybe even better
than the product itself. Something that
isn't available in the main product. This
gives your buyer incentive to get the
audio product. 
For example
Option 1: Courses & Coaching

Repurpose Content
If you already have a course,
challenge, event or coaching calls,
you can create an audio version. 
Hiro automatically converts videos to

too.

QUICK SALES
PRICING SUGGESTIONS
Although it might be tempting to add
your audio version to part of your
core offer, you not only are walking
away from some serious money. Let
me explain.
Not only are you giving up a higher
cart value, you are also giving up the
opportunity to offer your audio
product as a gift to anyone who
requests a refund. That alone has
save some Hiro customers thousands
of dollars a month. That's why I
suggest adding it as a bump or a one-
time offer. The price depends on the
price of your core offer. 
Around 10%-15% of your main
product price is usually a safe bet. 
So if your course sells for $2000, then
your audio version can be $20-$40.
But it all depends on the content and
the customer.
©Hiro LLC 2021 • All Rights Reserved
The best thing about repurposing
content is that you can sell it right
back to your original buyer's list. 
One Hiro customer turned her weekly
Facebook coachings into a private
audio product and sold subscriptions
for $11.11 a month (or 37¢ a day!). She
made over $3,300 her first week! 
In addition to selling your new audio
Order bump
One time offer
Single product
 
product to existing customers, you
can also offer it to new customers:
Lastly, you offer it free to customers
who can't find the time to get through
your video course & want a refund.
That alone can save $1000s!

Option 2: Best Hits

a Wall Street tycoon. One of tactics that she
mastered was the "hook" which quickly grew

Making Your Audio Irresistible
Unlike a course, this type of audio
more of a stand-alone product. Your
main goal is to make listening to your
audios a habit and giving them a quick
win. You need to create "triggers"
telling them to listen.
For example
Insiders only
Hypnotherapists, reiki masters, yogis,
or experts of any kind. This is also
great for anyone with a social media
following. This is exclusive content
that only your top fans or customers
would appreciate. 
This works great for monthly
subscriptions!

QUICK SALES
PRICING SUGGESTIONS
If this is your first time offering your
solution, you might be tempted to
give it away to those first customers.
But you'll be doing them a disservice.
If they don't have skin in the game,
they won't take action and won't get
results.
Instead, price it at the lowest price
you'll ever consider offering. For
example, you might want to offer it
for $97 later, so the beta group gets
access for just $7. You'll have some
pretty upset customers if you say
they get a crazy discount and end up
lowering the price even more later. 
If this isn't a beta product, price it
based on the results they get.
If it helps them earn $15K, then charge
them $500. If it saves them $10K in
lawyer feeds, charge them $100. If it's
a tire-kicker, charge $17 - $67
©Hiro LLC 2021 • All Rights Reserved
If you don't have a big list or
following, you can still profit from
audio fast. Let me show you how to
do that.
Start by sharing a big win you had
because of your secret process. For
example, maybe you cured your
insomnia with a hypnotherapy. Share
your before and after photo along
with the story of how you discovered
 
your answer. Share the RESULTS you
received from your hypnosis. If you
have a client who got great results,
share that too. 
Ask who wants access to the entire
system for a reduced price. These are
your beta testers. Have them
comment on your post, then quickly
follow up with a private message and
link to your sales page.  

Option 3: Audiobooks
Thanks to Audible, we are all familiar with
audiobooks and don't mind paying $17-$25 to
listen our way through the chapters. 
If you're a self-published author, your heart
might have skipped a beat when you discovered
how much it costs to publish the audio version of
your book on Audible. Not to mention the time it
takes, the revenues they keep, and the limited
data you have on each listener. Why bother?
With Hiro, you keep the profits, know exactly who
got your audiobook and how much they listened
to. 
But let's do more than give your customers an
audio version of your book. Let's make it
irresistible to them!
©Hiro LLC 2021 • All Rights Reserved
HOT TIPS
What's the one thing you wished you could do
when you're reading a really good book? Talk to
the author, right?
Give your audio listeners insights after each
chapter. You can do this by having a friend
interview you about each chapter.  If you need
inspiration, check out David Goggins audiobook,
"Can't Hurt Me".
Sell your book before you even write it. Create
the outline first, then record an audio for each
chapter. People pay for first draft access and
can give you valuable feedback!

Making Your Audio Irresistible
Unlike the paid audio products, these
types can be used to both grow your
list and nurture your audience. The key
is to break down any barriers they
might have buying your higher priced
offer. 
For example
Cold to hot
My friend who runs a Facebook ads
agency had a list of prospects who
were going cold fast. She didn't have
enough time to follow-up with them.
She decided to give them access to
her members-only podcast designed
to now only give them quick wins, but
get them ready to start working with
her as a client. Here's some ways you
can bank on that same concept:

Option 5: Performers
Performing artists like comedians, musicians,
spoken word, and story-tellers have a special
advantage when it comes to audio - their trained
voice. 
Selling access to their audio products through
their own site gives them a chance to keep all
the revenue, manage the audios, and offer more
products. 
Audio Product Ideas:
©Hiro LLC 2021 • All Rights Reserved
22. Your comedy or live shows
23. Exclusive recordings (plus inspiration)
24. Unfiltered, raw content (big brother style)
25. Crime, love, space or any kind of stories
26. Spoken word or rap challenge
27. Curated content (not copyright protected)
HOT TIPS
Fans want to feel close to the artist. They want to
know the inspiration, the story, the events that
lead up to creating the art they love.
Share insights and behind the scenes stories to
turn them into super fans. Include the
background story, banter while in the Green
Room, an unpublished interview. Anything that
gets them closer to your daily life.

a combination of the audio product
ideas to keep each episode fresh.
For example
Make it stick
Learning in an active state - like while
you're walking or doing the dishes - is

WELCOME EPISODE
Even if you are repurposing existing content into a private podcast, it
helps to have a welcome episode as your very first episode. This sets the
tone of the conversation, creates excitement and let's the listener know
what to expect ahead. 
You only need a welcome episode to start selling your product. You can
create the following episodes as you go! In fact, it's best to do that so you
create content that your listeners want and need!
Use the script below to quickly create your welcome episode.

END LISTEN & LEAVERS
Podcast platforms like Simplecast and
Transistor only let you release
episodes on a specific date. 
Hiro lets you drip out your content
so your podcast is evergreen.
This means that one customer can
start listening to episode 1 on Monday
and another customer start it two
days later. And they both will get an
episode a day - or however you want
to drip out your episodes.
This is incredibly powerful!
Let's say you're selling an audio
version of your course and you offer
a 2 week refund period. You can give
customers access to part of your
content the first two weeks and then
 unlock everything after the refund
period. This saves you from people
who consume your entire product and
then request a refund.
CREATE URGENCY
Another cool feature with Hiro is that
you can expire a listener's access to
an podcast.
This is perfect for challenges because
it creates urgency to listen before
access is automatically shut off.
KEEP EPISODES SHORT
If you're creating from scratch, try to
keep your episodes around 5-7
minutes. Listeners won't feel like they
need to find time to listen and can
binge listen - which is the best!
