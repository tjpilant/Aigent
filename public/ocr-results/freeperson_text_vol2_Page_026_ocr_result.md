the special relationship. This "self" seeks the relationship to make itself
complete.
Yet when it finds the special relationship in which it thinks it
can accomplish this it gives itself away, and tries to "trade" itself for the
self of another. This is not union, for there is no increase and no extension.
Each partner tries to sacrifice the self he does not want for one he thinks he
