"miracle" for this. I have said that if a brother asks a foolish thing of
you to do it.
But be certain that this does not mean to do a foolish thing
that would hurt either him or you, for what would hurt one will hurt tho
other. Foolish requests are foolish merely because they conflict, since they
always contain some element of specialness. Only the Holy Spirit recognizes
foolish needs as well as real ones. And He will teach you how to meet both
without losing either.
You will attempt to do this only in secrecy. And you will think that
by meeting the needs of one you do not jeopardize another, because you keep
them separate and secret from each other. That is not the way, for it leads
not to light and truth. No needs will long be left unmet if you leave them
all to Him Whose function is to meet them. That is His function, and not
yours. He will not meet them secretly, for He would share everything you
give through Him. That is why He gives it. What you give through Him is for
the whole Sonship, not for part of it. Leave Him His function, for Ho will
fulfill it if you but ask Him to enter your relationships, and bless them for
you.
The Power of Holiness
You may still think that holiness is impossible to understand, because
you cannot see how it can be extended to include everyone. And you have boen
told that it must include everyone to be holy. Concern yourself not with the
extension of holiness, for the nature of miracles you do not understand. Nor
do you do them. It is their extension, far beyond the limits you perceive,
that demonstrates you do not do them. Why should you worry how the miracle
extends to all the Sonship when you do not understand the miracle itsolf? Спо
attribute is no more difficult to understand than is the whole. If miracles
aro at all, their attributes would have to be miraculous, being part of them.
